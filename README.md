# Surfs Up Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a potential investor with weather information that would impact a surf and shake shop business venture on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Using Python I analyzed temperature data for June and December across 7 years to determine whether this business plan would be feasible given its high dependence on weather conditions.

### Results
As shown in the screenshots below of the summary statistics for June and December:
 - I found that the average temperature in June is approximately 75 degrees F and in December it is 71. 
 - The minimum temperature in June was recorded at 64 degrees, while December was 56.
 - The maximum temperature in June was recorded at 85 degrees, while December was 83.

### Summary
Given that the temperatures are, on average, relatively similar in summer and winter, it is reasonable to assume that customers would be interested in the surf and shake shop's offerings all year round. The minimum temperatures do lead me to consider performing additional queries for further insight, such as:
- Counting of the observations that are under 70 degrees. 
- Averaging the precipitation specifically for June and December as well as getting a count of days there was precipitation. 
These additional queries would allow me to see how often to expect cooler days when a dip in sales may occur.
